TODO
 - Ability to break external references as a pre-processing step
 - I need to properly unload all assemblies (and possibly shutdown mono runtime?) before I shut down various modules used in ScriptBansheeEngine.

 ---------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE:

setValue in ScriptSerializableObject & ScriptSerializableArray should check if value is null and if the field type isn't a value type (can't be null)

LOW PRIORITY
- Add Multi-dimensional arrays / Lists / Dictionaries
  - (To get array lengths per rank I probably need to cast to System.Array and then call GetLength)
- Ensure that unknown components retain their field data so when they are no longer unknown their data may be restored
- Get rid of ScriptObject::createInstance and replace it with parameter in constructor
- A way to serialize any object into a Resource (and deserialize it from Resource)

 ---------------------------------------

 Testing:
Test SerializableObject
Test arrays
Test arrays of arrays
Test references to Components
Test references to Resources
Test how structs work
Test how things work when class gets removed

Test and implement multi-rank arrays

 ------------------------------------------------------
 General C# component management

 Native components like Camera
  - ScriptCamera derives from Camera
    - Then whenever I check for managed Components I need to check if object type of ScriptComponent or
	  any of the built-in types. 
	   - Checking each type might be a bit slow, but normally we will be looking for an exact type
	     so hopefully this will only matter when enumerating all components which shouldn't be during performance
		 critical moments.

TODO - When reloading scripts how to handle restoring references?
TODO - When I destroy a Component, how will I refresh the inspector to let it know that something has changed
  - Can happen from C# and C++
