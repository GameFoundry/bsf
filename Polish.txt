There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats
 - Test overlay and add title labels for samples

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

I should be able to specify resolution when going to windowed mode
 - I have a feeling DX9 might start crashing once I resize to sub-fullscreen res and go back to FS - test it

 Add VSync toggle to RenderWindow if it doesn't already exist.
 Test creating a fullscreen window on window creation.

DISREGARD MONITOR INDEX ON DX9
 - It's not trivial and its not worth wasting time on a deprecated system
 - Seems I would need to destroy the device and then recreate it using the new adapter index

 -----------------------------

Rename CamelotOIS external library

Refactor Viewport as it is used on both core and sim threads and it has no locking of any kind.
