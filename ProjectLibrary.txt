
 - Resource import queue (ability to display progress bar for resources that are importing)
  - Plus modal windows?
 - Implement Delete command for ResourceTreeView

LOW PRIORITY

What happens when importer fails importing a file?
 - This can be one of the lasts steps, but I will likely need to go through all importers manually and set them up so they return proper error codes
    and clean up properly on error.
	- In fact they should use exceptions but those should be translated to error codes when returned to Importer
	  - OR just write directly to debug log?
	   - Probably log and error code, since I will need to inform the outside world that import failed somehow
