Test custom resources:
 - Can I load them? (Will likely need ProjectLIbrary::load)
 - Can I reference them in Component and will the reference be held after after cloning?

TODO:
 - Add SceneObject fields (Name, Position, Rotation, Scale and optional switches between world/local)
 - Properly hook up UndoRedo, for both in-field and object-wide changes
   - How do I track Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y keys? And in general how do I distinguish when I send
     input to the game and when to the editor.
 - GUIColor needs to be hooked up to a window that actually changes its value.





Polish (SECOND PASS - LATER):

 - Add a dictionary inspector.
    - Check Unity Full Inspector addon for inspiration on how it should look: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/full-inspector-inspector-and-serialization-for-structs-dicts-generics-interfaces.224270/
 - Add icons to array clone/delete/up/down buttons
 - Add support for multi-rank array inspector
 - Add tabbing between fields
 - Clicking on an object/resource in inspector should ping it in their window

----------------------------------------------

A way to close a window & destroy a GUI panel!
 - Will likely need to refactor ScriptEditorWindow as currently it performs initialization
   in constructor and destroy in destructor, but open/close will be called within its lifetime
 - Also a way to get notified if the window gets closed from C++
 - Once closed the referenced GUIPanels should no longer work (set "destroyed" flag?)
 - What about calling Destroy on a GUIPanel?
   - It should notify owning EditorWindow
 - IMPORTANT: Right now it seems there is Internal_Destroy method on managed GUIPanel but it isn't hooked up to the script

Ensure that setting depth for GUIArea works properly. It's not properly implemented yet.

 ----------------------

 Non-inspector:
  - Deleting first entry in input field moves the cursor incorrectly
  - ProfilerOverlay elements are constantly dirty? even though I'm not calling update

Undocking a window wont remove the tabbed title bar
While dragging an undocked window, dropping it over the main window (not over dock overlays) will not restore it
