-------------------------
Study shadow rendering implementations

Add basic light type components and their core thread representations
 - Directional, Point, Spot light
 - Luminous flux - intensity
 - Color
 - Directional - direction
 - Spot - angle, direction, position
 - Point - range (or derive that from flux?), position

Document all Light stutff
Light bounding box
Need to update light handler when parent component moves/rotates

Load up and set up a test-bed with Ribek's scene

Create a basic GBuffer - albedo, normal, depth
 - Using HDR formats where needed

Implement deferred rendering (just basic lambert shading for now, only point light)
 - Then convert to tiled rendering

-------------

Implement gamma correct rendering, HDR, tone mapping
 - Will likely need a simple framework for rendering full-screen effects
   (e.g. I will need to downsample scene to determine brightness here, but will
    also need that framework for all post-processing)

-------------

Implement shadows
 - Start with hard shadows
 - Move to PCF soft shadows (see if there's anything better)
 - Then cascaded maps

-------------

Later: 
 - Finish up all light types
 - Reflection probes
 - Proper PBR materials with reflection
 - Post-processing system - FXAA, SSAO, Color correction, Depth of field (Bokeh)
 - Forward rendering for transparent objects

-----------------

SECOND STAGE(S)
 - Occlusion
 - GI
 - Volumetric lighting
 - SSR
 - Depth pre-pass
 - HDR skybox, skylight stuff

-----------------

THIRD STAGE(S)
 - Skin & vegetation shaders
 - Tesselation/displacement/parallax
 - Water
 - Fog
 - Motion blur
 - Per object shadows
 - Extend camera with shutter speed (motion blur), aperture size and focal distance (depth of field), exposure (HDR)
