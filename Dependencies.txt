This document lists all Banshee 3rd party libraries and provides information on how to compile
and include them in your own project. It is meant to be used as a guide to create your own Banshee
project file, potentially for compiler/IDE other than Visual Studio.

BansheeEngine relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - Mono 3.2.3
    - http://www.mono-project.com
	- See MonoIntegrationGuide.txt on how to compile & integrate Mono

BansheeCore relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - NVIDIA Texture Tools 2.0.8
    - https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/
	- See NVTTCompilationGuide.txt on how to compile it for Banshee

Place dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Banshee plug-in dependencies:

BansheeFBXImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FBX SDK 2015.1
   - http://usa.autodesk.com/fbx

BansheeFreeImgImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FreeImage 3.13.1
  - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net

BansheeFontImporter (optional) relies on:
 - Freetype 2.3.5
  - http://www.freetype.org
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: When compiling as static library make sure to define "FREETYPE2_STATIC". It is not defined by default
    in provided Visual Studio projects, which can cause a headache.

BansheeOISInput (optional) relies on:
 - BansheeOIS - Slightly modified version of OIS 1.3 specifically for Banshee
  - Supplied with Banshee source code but compiled as a separate project into a dependency

BansheeD3D11RenderSystem & BansheeD3D9RenderSystem (both optional) rely on:
 - Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010
  - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
  - After installing the SDK make sure DXSDK_DIR environment variable is set up pointing to the installation path

Place plug-in specific dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Legend:
  (BansheeRootDir) - Path to BansheeEngine folder
  (Platform) - Platform you're compiling for, e.g. x86, x64, etc.
  (Configuration) - Debug, Release, DebugRelease

Other notes:
 - Some dependencies might not come with DebugRelease binaries, in which case use Release binaries (copy them to DebugRelease folder)
