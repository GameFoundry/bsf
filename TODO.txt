Assembly refresh

When serializing Camera I cannot save the reference to RenderTexture. Make it a Resource?
Possibly set up automatic refresh in debug mode after initialization? As an ad-hoc unit test

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project library

Almost all of PRojectLibrary functionality is completely untested

Figure out how to create a C# BuiltinResources class. It should be able to load arbitrary resources from a non-project folder
 - I should move all the GUI element style creation out of code and make it just pure data (once I have an editor for it)
 - Will also need a debug button to reimport all the built-in resources

My GUID generation is screwed up. If multiple GUIDs are generated in succession then the timestamp will remain
the same and the only variable will be the 4byte random number, which can sometimes end up identical to the previous number.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BuiltinResources
 - All data in ..\..\BuiltinData (if we start in /bin/Release/BansheeEd.exe)
 - Need BuiltinEngine and BuiltinEditor (separate classes) that internally do pretty much the same thing
   - Derive them from common base since most of the functionality will be reused
   - Make sure that commonly used resources are available directly and aren't required to call Load
 - Also have ..\..\RawBuiltinData where all the non-processed assets are
 - When compiled as debug, define Preprocess command which goes over all assets in ..\..\RawBuiltinData, imports them and outputs them to ..\..\BuiltinData
   - Preprocess can be done fully in C++

I need to make a GUISkin a resource so I can save it
 - It should be editable from the Editor (only when in debug mode) and not generated in code
 - Then in Preprocess it can just get copied from RawBuiltinData subfolder to the actual folder
 - Before I have editing capability it can just be generated in Preprocess step

Preprocess will also need to generate any Shaders or SpriteTextures
 - POSSIBLY wait until I get generate these assets directly in Editor, then just copy them over to Builtin
 - This way I can fully avoid writing any preprocess code

I still need to be able to access most of these assets from C++ (e.g. GUI element styles)
 - I need to add BuiltinResources.Load which should allow me to load all needed resources, from C++ or C#

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Resources
 - Load/Unload/UnloadUnused
 - Uses same paths as ProjectLibrary
 - It uses different logic depending on Application.isEditor
   - If not in editor then a different path is used
   - That path is ..\..\Data (relative to the executable)
   - When in editor it also does special ProjectLibrary check to ensure that resource is included in final project
 - Internally just calls Resources (C++) Load/Unload/UnloadUnused
 - Need a flag in ProjectLibrary to include a resource in the final build
   - Need to be able to set that flag from C# (Likely through ProjectLibrary) interface
 - The final build procedure for the game would then be:
   - Copy all the prebuilt binaries (Banshee libraries, Banshee assemblies, 3rd party libraries and prebuilt executable) from Editor install folder to output folder
    - Which set of binaries is used depends on selected platform (e.g. win/mac/linux or 32/64bit)
   - Recompile script assemblies if needed and copy them from project Internal folder to output folder
   - Copy the Builtin resources for engine from Editor install folder to output folder
   - Copy all the resources marked with the flag mentioned above to \Data subfolder in the output folder, preserving the same asset structure

Simple stuff

C#:
Dialog.Show(title, text, btn1 text, btn1 callback, btn2 text, btn2 callback, btn3 text, btn3 callback)

Other simple stuff:
 - Inject an icon into an .exe (Win32 specific)
 - C# wrapper for GUISkin (and a way to assign the current skin to a window)
 - Move all the code files into subfolders so their hierarchy is similar to VS filters
 - Font doesn't have a C# interface
 - Material/Shader/Technique/Pass don't have a C# interface
 - Get rid of PoolAlloc and other unused allocators (plus fix bs_new and others which have weird overloads)
 - Call stack from C# to use in Debug.Log calls
 - Get rid of event callback from HString and figure out a better way
 - GUI TextureField similar to ResourceField but it displays the texture it has assigned
 - Getting rid of import on start would be a pretty big deal. Just adding a button in Editor "Reimport" should be good instead
 - Better handle and gizmo shaders

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Handles

When scaling using center make sure to offset the object before scale
Handles should probably not having shading, or have better shading.

Rotate handle:
 - How to handle local/global with rotate handle?
   - This maybe just determines initial rotation of the handle?
   - I don't think my code properly handles rotation handle transforms (e.g. arc drawing)

Ideally free scale handle indicator should always render and be interactable and never be hidden by axis scale indicators (Not high priority)

Later:
 - Raycast snapping Ribek suggested

----------------------------------------------------------------------
C# Material

C# material interface:
 - Pass
 - GpuProgram
 - DepthStencilState
 - RasterizerState
 - BlendState
 - SamplerState
 - Technique
 - Shader
 - Material

--------

Include files:
 - Remove references to HGpuProgInclude when creating a GpuProgram
  - Keep using HGpuProgInclude since I need a special resource for includes (I don't want the importer to think 
     they're Shaders, plus I can avoid making a special case for them in the parser)
 - Instead try to find and load included shader files in BansheeSL by calling Resources
  - If resource cannot be found ignore it, but still register it as a dependency
 - All includes should be registered in ShaderManager
  - Whenever a shader is loaded this should be notified so it may recompile all shaders
 - GpuProgram::recompile(newSource)
   - TODO - Need info

ShaderManager will also be needed when I'm changing shader defines
 - TODO - Test shaders and ensure #defines work
  - DX11 might need to call D3DPreprocess and include a list of defines
 - GLSL - Need to manually specify #defines as separate lines

ShaderManager will also be needed when switching render APIs during runtime (if that will be possible)
 - It can also serve as a place where we perform shader caching

 - Separate languages for DX9 and DX11
 - If I import a shader that tries to compile for a language different than we have available, create a null GpuProgram

0. Move all shaders to new .shader format, ensure everything works
0.1. Check in new shaders as dependencies

1. Make render states and GPU program non-resources. Ensure they aren't referenced by handles anymore
1.1. Get rid of GpuProgram importer and modify how BuiltinResources imports shaders
2. Make render states and GPU programs be saved with the shader

3. Rename HGpuInc to HShaderInc and make its file format be ".bslinc". Remove includes from GpuProgram creation (GpuProgram has mergeWithIncludes method that needs removing as well)
4. Add ShaderManager that allows GPU programs to register themselves and to be recompiled once their includes change
  - TODO - Perhaps use ResourceListener instead?
5. Add support for includes in BansheeSL (injecting their code into actual shader source) + registering with shader manager
5.1. Modify existing shaders as I have some that share code but differ in state options only

6. Add support for registering default parameters (add a set of addParameter methods to SHADER_DESC). Keep sampler states and textures in a dynamic array, and all other data in a dynamic byte array.
7. Make sure initializing the material properly sets up default parameters

-------------------

TODO STAGE 2:
 - Handle include files (include files should just be plain text files with no additional parsing)
  - When includes that shaders depend on are imported/changes I need to recompile those shaders
    - Whenever a GPU program is created it registers itself with a manager and sets up the includes it relies on
	- Whenever .shader import is called, it scans through all includes and finds out if any shaders depend on them
	  - If so, it performs a recompile on those shaders
  - Currently I handle includes on a pretty low level. Maybe I should handle them in BansheeSL instead? (Directly injecting the include code into the source code)
  - How to handle parsing of include .shader files? They don't need techniques or passes.
 - Handle default values (ignore default values for shared param blocks for now)
   - additional argument in Shader::addParameter, copy values to buffers when initializing Material
 - Make sure shader saving works and optionally make GpuProgram a non-resource
  - Make sure GPU programs and states are saved with the Shader

TODO STAGE 3:
 - Move all builtin shaders to the new .shader file model

TODO LATER:
 - Add GpuProgram caching (e.g. save compiled programs somewhere for later use)
 - Consider adding restrictions on parameter ranges (probably via an additional qualifier)
 - Parameter definitions don't support arrays (Leave this for a later iteration)
 - Parameter definitions don't support structs
 - Better error reporting instead of just "syntax error" that better informs the user what the error is

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene View

AFTER I have scene widget in C#:
 - Test custom handles from C#
 - Test handle snapping

Need a way to drag and drop items from Scene tree view to Scene view
 - When dragging a mesh it should by default create a SceneObject with a renderable
 - I might want a C# DragAndDrop class? It can contain Resource or SceneObject only for now, similar to Selection

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Other

Got a crash on shutdown that was caused by locking a mutex in an Event destructor. Event was Platform::onMouseCaptureChanged. 
Issue happened when I closed the app via the X button (if that's relevant). It doesn't seem to happen always.

Create a stack allocatable custom vector implementation and make getResourceDependencies and getCoreDependencies use it.
 - These methods are called often and cause allocations whenever they are.

Add ProjectWindow and HierarchyWindow to C#
 - Make TreeViews a C# element?
Set up a default layout and save it

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-resource saving
 - Modify Font so it doesn't contain a texture, but instead keeps a handle to it
 - Register it in its meta file
 - When saving such a resource with dependencies save the contained files to a sub-directory with the same name as top level resource
   - If it already exists in the manifest at a different location do it anyway, keep the other copy as-is in case user wanted it that way
   - I'm not sure whether to do this for all Resource::save calls or only ones originating from ProjectLIbrary?

Mono notes

I can get mono errors by checking g_print calls in goutput.c
 - Calling thunks incorrectly can cause those weird errors with no real callstack

Running embedded mono with VS attached causes managed null refs to be registered as access violations

There seems to be a bug in Mono when passing complex structs from C# to C++. e.g. passing Rect3 as a parameter
will corrupt the parameter after it, even if layout and size is exact as the C++ version. 
Rect3 has child structs (Vector3) which could be the reason. Be aware of other similar problems.

Mono cannot marshal structures? Taken from their documentation:
 Internal calls do not provide support for marshalling structures. This means that any API calls that take a structure 
 (excluding the system types like int32, int64, etc) must be passed as a pointer, in C# this means passing the value as a "ref" or "out" parameter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MenuItem

LATER: Add keyboard controls to GUIMenuBar (left/right arrows should move between entries if user is not browsing a sub-menu)
 - esc should cancel out of the menu bar
 - alt should focus the menu bar

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VisualStudio integration

VS integration will likely not work with VSExpress or Community edition
 - VSExpress doesn't support EnvDTE so the only option is to open it using a shell command which doesn't seem to offer precise parameters
 - Community edition should work similarily to Pro, but might have a different executable and/or registry paths

For later:
 - Make sure that 3rd party assemblies can be imported in the project, and that they are properly referenced in VS project generation and compilation

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Script compilation

For later:
 - I need to hook up script compilation with assembly refresh, and the build system.
   - e.g. when recompiling inside the editor it should automatically start compiling when changes are detected,
     show some kind of visual indicator and refresh assemblies when its done. When publishing it should recompile
	 assemblies for release. Also hook up console to compiler output?
