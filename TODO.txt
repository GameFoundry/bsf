--------- ALL LONG TERM TASKS / FIXES BELONG TO GOOGLE DOCS: ImplementationTODO OR PossibleImprovements ----------

 New issues:
  - Since Mesh refactor when I select/deselect a gizmo the entire render texture flashes white for one frame (might be related to RT refactor instead)

1. Make sure shader create() methods returns a HShader
2. Make sure material uses HShader
3. Make sure material listens for HShader load event (derives from IResourceListener)
4. Delay material initialization until its shader and gpu programs are fully loaded (keep the core thread sync there as is for now)

Resource saving
 - Keep save as is, only the exact resource is saved without any dependencies
 - However to each resource append InternalResourceMeta as a header which keeps a
   list of dependant resources which is generated whenever a resource is saved
   (Use the method described below to find dependencies)

Resource import
 - Extend Resource meta-data to contain a list of CONTAINED(not the same as dependant) resources
   - So that ProjectLibrary knows to save that resource upon reimport

Resource unload
 - Still unloads just a single resource
 - However refactor unloadUnused to be better (essentially a garbage collector):
   - Find all resources referenced by the item we're unloading (Use method described below)
   - Find ones that have no references left and unload them
     - This is similar to what Unity does

Resource load
 - Use the dependant resource list described above to find a list of assets to load (load the list synchronously)
 - Start loading all the assets using chosen method (sync/async)
   - I'll have to disable/modify current method of loading resource handles as soon as they're deserialized
     as they call load (sync) which will overwrite any async behavior.
 - Only when loading of all dependant resources is done should the resource handles be marked as loaded
   (To prevent having loaded a Material but not its Shader)
 - Need to disable async loading for certain types (like SceneObject/Component and possibly others) - Just a flag in Resource

I think I will most definitely need an utility method that walks entire scene hierarchy and returns all
dependant resources (including from scripts)
 - Go over all RTTI fields recursively. Make sure to iterate over arrays and go inside IReflectable objects.
 - Refactor ManagedComponent and ManagedResource so they include a list of their fields in their RTTI
   - They already do but currently it's only generated upon serialization. I need it to be available always and I'll probably want to decouple it from field values.
 - This way I find all fields using normal RTTI methods.
 - Possible problem: If RTTI has special callbacks for deserialization and its "get" method doesn't work without them. But deal with that on a case by case basis
   - This might be a problem with managed obj serialization as its field data is generated in a callback, consider generating it in "get()" method instead.

-----------------

Ensure that EditorWindow resize callback works properly.
 - Perhaps add OnResizeEnd callback that can be used for updating the render texture
Create a C# wrapper around ProjectSettings
Make a Script version of SceneEditorWindow
 - This would replace SceneEditorWidget so it would initialize scene grid and call
    update on handle manager and scene grid, as well as apply ProjectSettings to them.
 
Move handle is buggy as hell - It moves in wrong direction sometimes, sometimes it skips, other times collision seems to be wrong
Need a way to drag and drop items from Scene tree view to Scene view
When dragging a handle make sure it works when cursor leaves the scene view
Also make sure that handle manager receives mouse up event if its done outside of scene view

AFTER I have scene widget in C#:
 - Finish up C# Handles class so it returns proper values
 - Ensure fixed handle size and handle snapping works
 - Implement free move handle and remaining handles
 - Test custom handles from C#

IMPLEMENT SELECTION RENDERING

IMPROVE SceneGrid LOOK
 - LIKELY USE PIXEL SceneGrid WITH AA
 - OR (better) instead of drawing rows and columns of lines, just draw a plane with procedural texture

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Handles

SliderLine - position, direction, length
  - When initially activated it records position nearest so the line as the starting point
  - Further mouse dragging also finds nearest position to the line
  - Difference between those two results in a float value (how much to move along direction from position to reach new position)
  - Slider line has a capsule + sphere collider size of which can be set manually

SliderPlane - position, normal, size
  - Similar to line slider only the direction is determined dynamically as well as distance
  - Outputs a Vector2 (direction * distance moved)
  - A OOB is used as a collider

SliderDisc - position, normal, radius
  - When initially activated it records position nearest so the disc as the starting point
  - Further movement calculates the dynamic direction from the starting point to the current point on the plane the disc lies on
  - Distance along that direction is returned as amount of movement (similar to line slider)
  - Outputs a single float
  - A torus is used as a collider

Free move/rotate/scale handles need to exist as well
 - Scale is easy, just perform uniform scale. Use SliderPlane oriented towards camera
 - Move also use SliderPlane oriented towards camera
 - Rotation use SliderDisc oriented towards camera

----------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1

CONCRETE TODO:
HandleSliderPlane/HandleSliderDisc
 - update() implementation

----------------------------------------------------
STAGE 2
Implement RotateHandle & ScaleHandle in C#
 - Nearest point to disc/arc code
Add free move, free rotate, free scale functionality
Handles that remain the same size regardless of distance from camera
 - For both drawing and collision

 More complex types for drawing like DrawArrow in HandleDrawManager

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SelectionRenderer

Retrieve a list of selected objects from SelectionManager
Find ones with Renderable components
Retrieve Meshes, and world transforms from them
Draw that same mesh with either a wireframe or a grayed out shader with a slight depth bias
