--------- ALL LONG TERM TASKS / FIXES BELONG TO GOOGLE DOCS: ImplementationTODO OR PossibleImprovements ----------

 New issues:
  - Since Mesh refactor when I select/deselect a gizmo the entire render texture flashes white for one frame (might be related to RT refactor instead)

1. Make sure shader create() methods returns a HShader
2. Make sure material uses HShader
3. Make sure material listens for HShader load event (derives from IResourceListener)
4. Delay material initialization until its shader and gpu programs are fully loaded (keep the core thread sync there as is for now)

5. Make RenderTexture accept a HTexture

See GDrive/Resources doc for resources refactor

C# SceneView:
Test new Scene window and fix every issue
Add ProjectWindow and HierarchyWindow to C#
 - Make TreeViews a C# element?
Set up a default layout and save it

Handle snapping is probably set up wrong. Handles.SnapValue seems to wrap a value instead of snapping, plus I might
need to store the unsnapped amount somewhere until it reaches some amount worthy of snapping to next value

-----------------

Move handle is buggy as hell - It moves in wrong direction sometimes, sometimes it skips, other times collision seems to be wrong
Need a way to drag and drop items from Scene tree view to Scene view
When dragging a handle make sure it works when cursor leaves the scene view
Also make sure that handle manager receives mouse up event if its done outside of scene view

AFTER I have scene widget in C#:
 - Finish up C# Handles class so it returns proper values
 - Ensure fixed handle size and handle snapping works
 - Implement free move handle and remaining handles
 - Test custom handles from C#

IMPLEMENT SELECTION RENDERING

IMPROVE SceneGrid LOOK
 - LIKELY USE PIXEL SceneGrid WITH AA
 - OR (better) instead of drawing rows and columns of lines, just draw a plane with procedural texture

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Handles

SliderLine - position, direction, length
  - When initially activated it records position nearest so the line as the starting point
  - Further mouse dragging also finds nearest position to the line
  - Difference between those two results in a float value (how much to move along direction from position to reach new position)
  - Slider line has a capsule + sphere collider size of which can be set manually

SliderPlane - position, normal, size
  - Similar to line slider only the direction is determined dynamically as well as distance
  - Outputs a Vector2 (direction * distance moved)
  - A OOB is used as a collider

SliderDisc - position, normal, radius
  - When initially activated it records position nearest so the disc as the starting point
  - Further movement calculates the dynamic direction from the starting point to the current point on the plane the disc lies on
  - Distance along that direction is returned as amount of movement (similar to line slider)
  - Outputs a single float
  - A torus is used as a collider

Free move/rotate/scale handles need to exist as well
 - Scale is easy, just perform uniform scale. Use SliderPlane oriented towards camera
 - Move also use SliderPlane oriented towards camera
 - Rotation use SliderDisc oriented towards camera

----------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1

CONCRETE TODO:
HandleSliderPlane/HandleSliderDisc
 - update() implementation

----------------------------------------------------
STAGE 2
Implement RotateHandle & ScaleHandle in C#
 - Nearest point to disc/arc code
Add 2D move and scale
Add free move, free rotate, free scale functionality
Handles that remain the same size regardless of distance from camera
 - For both drawing and collision

 More complex types for drawing like DrawArrow in HandleDrawManager

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SelectionRenderer

Retrieve a list of selected objects from SelectionManager
Find ones with Renderable components
Retrieve Meshes, and world transforms from them
Draw that same mesh with either a wireframe or a grayed out shader with a slight depth bias
