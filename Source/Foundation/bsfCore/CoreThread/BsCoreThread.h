	 *  - Commands from various threads can be queued for execution on the core thread by calling queueCommand() or
	 *    queueReturnCommand().
	 *   - Internally each thread maintains its own separate queue of commands, so you cannot interleave commands from
	 *     different threads.
	 *   - There is also the internal command queue, which is the only queue directly visible from the core thread.
	 *    - Core thread continually polls the internal command queue for new commands, and executes them in order they were
	 *      submitted.
	 *    - Commands queued on the per-thread queues are submitted to the internal command queue by calling submit(), at
	 *      which point they are made visible to the core thread, and will begin executing.
	 * 	  - Commands can also be submitted directly to the internal command queue (via a special flag), but with a
	 * 	    performance cost due to extra synchronization required.
