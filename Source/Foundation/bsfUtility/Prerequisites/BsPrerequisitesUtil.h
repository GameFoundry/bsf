/**
 * @page scriptBindingMacro Script binding exports
 *
 * Marks the specific type or a method to be exported to the scripting API. Supports a variety of options which can
 * be specified in the "option:value" format, where multiple options are separated by commas, with no whitespace.
 *
 * Supported options:
 *  - n - Specify a different name for the type in the scripting API (e.g. "n:MyName"). Usable on types and methods.
 *  - v - Specify a different visibility (default is public). Supported values are "public", "internal" and "private".
 *		  Usable on types and methods.
 *  - f - Specify the name of the output file(s) for the script object and its potential wrappers. If not specified
 *		  the name of the type will be used for the file. Usable on types only.
 *	- pl - Specify whether the type is plain or not (default is false). Supported values are "true" or "false". Plain
 *		  types don't have script interop objects generated, instead they are generated in script code as plain data
 *		  types. No methods are exposed, but all data members and constructors are copied. Usable on types only.
 *	- e - Specify that a method is external and is to be appended to some script class. Such methods must be static
 *		  and as the first parameter accept the instance of the class they operate on. Value of this option should be
 *		  the name of the class to attach this method to. Methods with this parameter must also be part of a class
 *		  with this option. Usable on types and methods.
 *	- ec - Similar to "e", but specifies an external constructor. Such method must have a return value that returns
 *		   an instance of the class its registered for. Value of this option should be the name of the class to attach
 *		   this method to. Methods with this parameter must also be part of a class with the "e" option. Usable on methods
 *		   only.
 *	- pr - Specify the method should be exported as a property in script code. Supported values are "getter" or "setter".
 *		  Getter methods must return a single value and accept no parameters, while setter methods must accept one
 *		  parameter and return no values. Usable on methods only.
 *	- ed - Specify that a type should be exported for use in the editor only. Supported values are "true" or "false".
 *		   Usable on types only.
 *  - ex - Excludes an enum or struct member from being generated in script code. Supported values are "true" or "false".
 *		   By default all struct & enum members are exported.
 *  - in - When enabled ensures only the interop C# method is generated, but not a public one. It is instead expected
 *		   the user will manually implement the public method. Supported values are "true" or "false". Default is "false".
 *		   Only supported on methods.
 *  - m  - Specifies the name of the module to place the entry in. This determines the documentation group, and may also
 *		   determine namespace and/or module (e.g. m:Animation to place it in the Animation module). Usable on types.
