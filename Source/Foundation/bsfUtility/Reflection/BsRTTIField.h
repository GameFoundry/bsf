	 * Types of fields we can serialize:
	 * 			
	 * - Plain - Native data types, POD (Plain old data) structures, or in general types we don't want to (or can't) inherit from IReflectable.   
	 *			 Type must be copyable by memcpy.
	 *			  
	 * - DataBlock - Array of bytes of a certain size. When returning a data block you may specify if its managed or unmanaged.  
	 *				 Managed data blocks have their buffers deleted after they go out of scope. This is useful if you need to return some
	 *				 temporary data. On the other hand if the data in the block belongs to your class, and isn't temporary, keep the data unmanaged.
	 *				 
	 * - Reflectable - Field that is of IReflectable type. Cannot be a pointer to IReflectable and must be actual value type.   
	 *				   Type and its fields are serialized recursively. Supports versioning so you may add/remove fields from the type
	 *				   without breaking previously serialized data.
	 * 
	 * - ReflectablePtr - A pointer to IReflectable. Same as "Reflectable" except that data isn't serialized as a value type,  
	 *					  but as a pointer, which may be referenced by multiple other instances. All references are saved upon
	 *					  serialization and restored upon deserialization.

		 * In short: If you make a reference weak, when "set" method of that field is called,
