	 *
	 * Buffer types:
	 *  - Raw buffers containing a block of bytes that are up to the GPU program to interpret.
	 *	- Structured buffer containing an array of structures compliant to a certain layout. Similar to raw buffer but 
	 *    easier to interpret the data.
	 *	- Random read/write buffers that allow you to write to random parts of the buffer from within the GPU program, and 
	 *    then read it later. These can only be bound to pixel and compute stages.
	 *	- Append/Consume buffers also allow you to write to them, but in a stack-like fashion, usually where one set of 
	 *    programs produces data while other set consumes it from the same buffer. Append/Consume buffers are structured
	 *	  by default.
