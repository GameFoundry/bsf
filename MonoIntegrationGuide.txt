Download mono 3.2.3 source from http://download.mono-project.com/sources/.

Mono can be a bit problematic to compile on Windows as MSVC solution is not maintained very often. 
Cygwin option that is provided doesn't come with a 64bit configuration, plus it also has errors.

--------------------------------------Compiling with Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 7 x64--------------------------------------------------
 - 3.2.3 version is missing "mono.props" file and without it Visual Studio will fail to open some project files. To fix download the .props file 
   from https://raw.github.com/mono/mono/master/msvc/mono.props and put it in mono-3.2.3\msvc folder before opening any projects or solution
 - Even though solution is VS2010, it will only compile with VS2012 unless you change platform toolkit to 
   v10 for all projects. (Haven't actually tested with VS2010)
 - If compiler complains it cannot find pthreads.h make sure to define "HAS_64BITS_ATOMIC" in libmonoutils project (for all configurations)
 - In dlmalloc.c change #include <dlmalloc.h> to #include "dlmalloc.h" if compiler complains it cannot find that file
 - In "mono-proclib.c" add this bit of code somewhere near the start of the file:

#ifdef HOST_WIN32
#define strtoll _strtoi64
#define strtoull _strtoui64
#endif

  - In "threads.c" replace a line in ves_icall_System_Threading_Interlocked_CompareExchange_Long method, from:

return InterlockedCompareExchange64 (location, value, comparand);

    to

#ifdef HOST_WIN32
	return _InterlockedCompareExchange64 (location, value, comparand);
#else
	return InterlockedCompareExchange64 (location, value, comparand); 
#endif

    InterlockedCompareExchange64 is just a typedef for _InterlockedCompareExchange64 on Windows and for some
	reason compiler doesn't realize it (typedefs to intrinstics don't work?). Anyway, so we just reference the intrinsic
	directly.

  - In "threads.c" replace a line in ves_icall_System_Threading_Thread_VolatileRead8 method, from:

return InterlockedCompareExchange64 (ptr, 0, 0);
     
	to

#ifdef HOST_WIN32
	return _InterlockedCompareExchange64 (ptr, 0, 0);
#else
	return InterlockedCompareExchange64 (ptr, 0, 0);    
#endif

    Same problem as previous.

  - For all projects and configurations update their property pages under "C/C++->Optimization" and set "Enable Intrinsic Functions" to "Yes"
    - You might be able to skip this step.
  - In "exceptions-amd64.c" replace line 121:

if (win32_chained_exception_needs_run) { 
    
   with

if (mono_win_chained_exception_needs_run) {

  - In "exceptions-amd64.c" delete lines 167 and 168:

if (old_win32_toplevel_exception_filter)
	SetUnhandledExceptionFilter(mono_old_win_toplevel_exception_filter);

  - In "exceptions-amd64.c" move line 166 (line # after previous changes) to start of the function:

guint32 ret = 0;

  - in threads.c in mono_thread_get_stack_bounds method replace the bit of code under "#if defined(HOST_WIN32)" from:

void* tib = (void*)__readfsdword(0x18);
guint8 *stackTop = (guint8*)*(int*)((char*)tib + 4);
guint8 *stackBottom = (guint8*)*(int*)((char*)tib + 8);

    to:

NT_TIB* tib = (NT_TIB*)NtCurrentTeb();
guint8 *stackTop = (guint8*)tib->StackBase;
guint8 *stackBottom = (guint8*)tib->StackLimit;

    __readfsdword doesn't exist when building 64bit. Use may use __readgsqword instead but then you need
	to double all your offsets. NtCurrentTeb works equally for both 32 and 64 bit builds.

  - Build "mono" project. 
  - You should end up with mono-2.0.dll, mono-2.0.lib, MonoPosixHelper.dll and mono.exe and we are done compiling

-------------------------------Special Banshee-specific changes--------------------------------------------

Move & modify:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic) MONO_INTERNAL; 
from object-internals.h
to:
  MONO_API MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic);
in object.h

In reflection.c change:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic)
to:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic)


--------------------------------Integrating Mono into Banshee----------------------------------------------
 - Add mono-2.0.dll to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Add mono-2.0.lib to (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Install mono 3.2.3 prebuilt binaries
   - Copy contents of (PrebuiltMonoFolder)/include/mono/mono-2.0/mono to (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include/Mono
   - Copy folders (PrebuiltMonoFolder)/etc and (PrebuiltMonoFolder)/lib folders into (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono
     - TODO - Not all files from /lib are needed, but I haven't yet determined which are
 - TODO - mono.exe and mono compiler are not used at the moment. Update docs once they are.
