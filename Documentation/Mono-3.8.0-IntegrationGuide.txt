---------------------------------Compiling runtime-------------------------------------

 - Retrieve Mono 3.8.0 source from GitHub (NOT the tar ball)
    - Tar ball has a broken Visual Studio build. (You can try to fix it, likely only a small modification. I didn't bother.)
 - Open in VS2012 as is, or open in later VS and upgrade all projects to latest toolkit (v120 and v140 tested and working)
 - Add "mono/utils/mono-conc-hashtable.c"  and "mono/utils/mono-conc-hashtable.c" to libmonoutils project
 - For x64 release version make sure to disable "omit stack frames" optimization

 - Move & modify:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic) MONO_INTERNAL; 
from object-internals.h
to:
  MONO_API MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic);
in object.h

In reflection.c change:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic)
to:
  MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic)

In mini-amd64.h:
  Find where definitions of MONO_ARCH_NOMAP32BIT are for various platforms, and below them add:
   #ifdef HOST_WIN32
   #define MONO_ARCH_NOMAP32BIT
   #endif

 - Compile mono project with desired configuration (debug/release, 32/64 bit, SGen builds were not tested). You will receive mono-2.0.dll and mono-2.0.lib as output.
 - Add mono-2.0.dll to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Add mono-2.0.lib to (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)

-----------------------------Compiling libraries & compiler-------------------------------------

- Install Mono 3.2.3 (This is the latest binary release for Windows, you can use newer if there is one).
- Add the "(InstallDir)\Mono-3.2.3\bin" to your PATH environment variable.
- Install Cygwin 32-bit version using these command line parameters:
 setup-x86.exe -qnNdO -R "C:\cygwin" -s "http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com" 
  -l "C:\cygwin\var\cache\setup" -P autoconf -P automake -P bison -P gcc-core 
  -P gcc-g++ -P mingw-runtime -P mingw-binutils -P mingw-gcc-core -P mingw-gcc-g++ 
  -P mingw-pthreads -P mingw-w32api -P libtool -P make -P python -P gettext-devel 
  -P gettext -P intltool -P libiconv -P pkg-config -P git -P wget -P curl

- Configure Cygwin mounting options by editing /etc/fstab and add "noacl" option like so:
 - "none /cygdrive cygdrive binary,noacl,posix=0,user 0 0"

- Retrieve Mono 3.8.0 source tar ball (NOT from github, opposite from above)
   - Github one has a broken Cygwin build. (You can try to fix it, likely only a small modification. I didn't bother.)
- Go to your mono 3.8 source directory in Cygwin and enter these commands in order:
 - "./autogen.sh --prefix="(OutputDir)" --with-preview=yes"" (Replace (OutputDir) with a folder where you want to output the binaries, e.g. "C:\MonoInstall")
 - "./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32"
 - "make"
 - "make install"
- Your built mono should now be output to (OutputDir) folder. (If it's not in that folder then check your Cygwin install folder under /usr/local)
- Copy contents of (OutputDir)/include/mono/mono-2.0/mono to (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include/Mono
  - Make sure to modify "object.h" as you did above when building the binaries
- Copy folder (OutputDir)/etc to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono
- Copy assembly folders (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.0 and (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.5 to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/lib/mono/4.0 and (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/lib/mono/4.5, respectively
 - If you wish, you can clean up the assemblies within those folders are many might not be used. The minimum needed are "mscorlib.dll", "System.dll" and "System.Core.dll".
- Copy the compiler (mcs.exe) from (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.5 to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/compiler
