# Roadmap

Focus right now is to implement the most critical missing features:
 - Physics (colliders, triggers, rigidbodies, joints, character controller)
 - Animation (skeletal, blend shapes, generic script variables)
 - Audio (popular file format support, music, 3D audio)
 
The plan is to finish these roughly around mid-2016.

---------------------------------------------------

Quickly to follow will be:
 - Ports for Linux & Mac
 - Vulkan (and possibly DX12) implementation
 - Physically based renderer
 - Website for the community
 
These are planned for an early 2017 release.

---------------------------------------------------

There are many more features planned, but these are without a specific timeline or order:
 - Mobile render API (likely Vulkan, possibly Metal for iOS)
 - Android/iOS/WP ports
 - High level networking (replication, RPCs)
 - Dynamic global illumination (+ other high fidelity graphical improvements)
 - Occlussion culling
 - Terrain
 - Effects/Particle editor
 - AI support
 - Cinematics editor
 - Higher level resource streaming support (including level and texture streaming)
 - Unified shading language
 - Visual shader editor
 - More specialized 2D editor features
 - Script debugging
 - Level of detail
 - XBONE/PS4 ports
 - And more to be decided later...
 
Implementation times for each of those roughly ranges from 1-4 months.

More contributors mean we can add more of these features quicker. Consider contributing!
