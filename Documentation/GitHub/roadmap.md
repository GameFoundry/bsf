# Roadmap

We are currently focusing on finish up a final set of features before releasing 1.0 stable. These features are:
 - Physically based renderer
 - Linux/Mac ports

Planned for Q2 2017 release

---------------------------------------------------

Following 1.0 release the focus will be on following features (in no specific order): 
 - Sprites & 2D rendering
 - 2D physics (Box2D integration)
 - 2D animation (Sprite based at least, likely bones as well)
 - Mobile render API (likely Vulkan, possibly Metal for iOS)
 - Android/iOS/WP ports
 - High level networking (replication, RPCs)
 - Effects/Particle editor
 - Terrain system
 - Visual GUI editor 
 
And more to come after that:
 - Dynamic global illumination (+ other high fidelity graphical improvements)
 - Occlussion culling
 - AI (pathfinding, navmesh)
 - VR support
 - Cinematics editor
 - Visual shader editor
 - More specialized editor tools for 2D games
 - Script debugging
 - Level of detail
 - XBONE/PS4 ports
 - BSP brushes for level prototyping
 - Offline lightmapper
 - And more to be decided later...
 
Implementation times for each of those roughly ranges from 1-4 months.
