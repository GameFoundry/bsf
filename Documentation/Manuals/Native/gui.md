Creating custom GUI elements						{#customGUI}
===============
[TOC]

Sometimes the built-in GUI elements are just not enough, for example when you need a very specific GUI element for your game (e.g. for displaying graphs, charts), want to use a special material or in general just need some more customization options. While in some cases you could construct such elements from the provided GUI elements, it is often more efficient to create a brand new customized type. New GUI elements can be created relatively easily and allow you to fully customize the look and interaction with your element.

Before starting you should familiarize yourself how Banshee's GUI works from the users perspective. Make sure to read the scripting GUI manual to understand the basics (although the manual is for scripting, the C++ versions of these methods are essentially equivalent and the same concepts apply).

All GUI elements derive from the base @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElementBase "GUIElementBase" type. The elements can be categorized into two major groups:
 - GUILayout: They derive from @ref BansheeEngine::GUILayout "GUILayout" and do not have any graphics, but instead they control the placement of all elements attached to them.
 - GUIElement: They derive from @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement "GUIElement", and they're standard GUI elements like buttons, input boxes, sliders and such.
 
You will almost certainly be interested in `GUIElement`, and are unlikely to need to create custom `GUILayout` types.

# Basic GUI element # {#customGUI_a}
When creating a custom GUI element you will need to override the @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement "GUIElement" type. The minimum set of methods you need to implement for your custom elements are:
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_getOptimalSize "_getOptimalSize()" - Return the optimal size of your GUI element. This is used for controlling the size of the element in a layout (if it's not fixed). For example if your element was displaying a texture 64x64 in size, then the optimal size should probably return 64x64. If you element is displaying text you can use @ref BansheeEngine::GUIHelper "GUIHelper" to help you calculate the bounds of the text. If displaying something else then it's up to you to determine what constitutes an optimal size.
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_getNumRenderElements() "_getNumRenderElements()" - Return the number of separate elements that your GUIElement consists of. Each element has its own mesh, material and texture. In most cases there is only one element.
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_getMeshSize() "_getMeshSize()" - Returns the number of vertices and indices for the mesh of the render element at the specified index (e.g. one quad (4 vertices, 6 indices) if the GUI element displays just one texture). This allows external systems to know how big of a buffer to allocate for the element's mesh.
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_fillBuffer() "_fillBuffer()" - This is the meat of the `GUIElement` override. It allows you to fill a buffer with vertices, uv coordinates and indices for a mesh for the specified render element. This allows you to fully control the look of your GUI element by providing customized geometry.
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_getMaterial() "_getMaterial()" - Here you should return a material that will be applied to the mesh output in the previous method, as well as an optional texture or color tint. You can choose from a set of pre-built materials or use your own material. 
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::updateRenderElementsInternal() "updateRenderElementsInternal()" - Called whenever the element's size or style changes. In this method you should rebuild the element's mesh. (While you could build the mesh in `_fillBuffer` it is inefficient as `_fillBuffer` will get called much more often than `updateRenderElementsInternal` due to mesh batching).
 
In order to help you with creating GUI meshes and materials make sure to take a look at @ref BansheeEngine::ImageSprite "ImageSprite" and @ref BansheeEngine::TextSprite "TextSprite" classes. `ImageSprite` can easily generate image geometry of specified size, whether a simple quad or a scale-9-grid image. And `TextSprite` will take a text string, font and additional options as input, and output a set of quads required for text rendering.

To retrieve materials used for rendering GUI use the @ref BansheeEngine::SpriteManager "SpriteManager", which contains a few built-in materials. You can also create your own materials by implementing the @ref BansheeEngine::SpriteMaterial "SpriteMaterial" interface and registering it with @ref BansheeEngine::SpriteManager "SpriteManager" by calling @ref BansheeEngine::SpriteManager::registerMaterial "SpriteManager::registerMaterial".

When constructing the `GUIElement` you will also need to provide a style-name (see next chapter) and dimensions to the `GUIElement` constructor. The dimensions determine the initial size of the element. To use the default dimensions just provide the constructor with return value from @ref BansheeEngine::GUIDimensions::create() "GUIDimensions::create()". `GUIElement` will internally use dimensions provided by its style, but providing custom `GUIDimensions` allows you to override the dimensions of the style. For that reason you should provide the user with a constructor that accepts @ref BansheeEngine::GUIOptions "GUIOptions" object, which will contain optional dimension overrides the user can specify. Then you can create a `GUIDimension` by providing the `GUIOptions` object as a parameter.

It is highly suggested you check out an implementation of @ref BansheeEngine::GUITexture "GUITexture" (in *BsGUITexture.cpp*) for a simple implementation of everything mentioned.

# Style # {#customGUI_b}

Every `GUIElement` has an access to a specific style (@ref BansheeEngine::GUIElementStyle "GUIElementStyle"). You can access the style by calling @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_getStyle() "GUIElement::_getStyle()". The style controls the look of your elements, including its texture, text style and margins. When creating a custom `GUIElement` you normally don't need to worry about style options like margins or padding, but you should take the rest into account when creating your mesh and material. You could also choose to ignore the style at the consequence of not having a skinnable `GUIElement`.

You might also need to override @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::styleUpdated() "GUIElement::styleUpdated()" method that will trigger when the user changes the `GUIElement`'s style, depending on your needs. Although in most cases it will be not necessary as a style change will trigger a call to `updateRenderElementsInternal()`, so you can retrieve the new style information there, as well as rebuild any contents as needed.

You should also provide a style-name for your element. This is a string that will be used for looking up the default style for the element, and you must provide it to the `GUIElement` constructor. This name will be used for looking up the exact `GUIElementStyle` in the currently active `GUISkin` (see later for infomation about GUI skins). You might also allow the user to provide a custom style name if needed (e.g. sometimes its nice to be able to style a `GUIToggle` element so it looks like a `GUIButton`).

# Input # {#customGUI_c}

If you implemented everything so far you should have a functional GUIElement that has a custom look, but it still doesn't accept any input. In order to accept input you must override some or all of the following methods:
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_mouseEvent "GUIElement::_mouseEvent" - Triggered when the mouse moves and/or is clicked
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_textInputEvent "GUIElement::_textInputEvent" - Triggered when the user inputs some text on the keyboard
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_virtualButtonEvent "GUIElement::_virtualButtonEvent" - Triggered when a certain virtual button is pressed.
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_commandEvent "GUIElement::_commandEvent" - Triggers when some kind of a specialized event happens, like losing/gaining focus, deleting text, selecting text, forcing redraw and similar. See @ref BansheeEngine::GUICommandEventType "GUICommandEventType" for an explanation of what each event type does.
 
Check out `_mouseEvent` implementation in @ref BansheeEngine::GUIButtonBase "GUIButtonBase" for a simple implementation of a mouse hover on/off and click functionality. Check @ref BansheeEngine::GUIInputBox "GUIInputBox" for a more complex implementation of input.

If working with text input also take a look at @ref BansheeEngine::GUIInputCaret "GUIInputCaret" and @ref BansheeEngine::GUIInputSelection "GUIInputSelection", as they help with input caret movement and text selection. Instances of these classes can be accessed from @ref BansheeEngine::GUIManager "GUIManager" with @ref BansheeEngine::GUIManager::getInputCaretTool() "getInputCaretTool()" and @ref BansheeEngine::GUIManager::getInputSelectionTool() "getInputSelectionTool()". This is completely optional and you may choose to handle these manually. See @ref BansheeEngine::GUIInputBox "GUIInputBox" for example usage.

# Updating # {#customGUI_d}

If your element allows the user to update certain contents of it after creation (i.e. it's not static), you need to notify the GUI system so it knows when to rebuild the element. For example if your GUI element displays a text string you might provide a `setText` method that allows the user to change what is displayed. When that is done the GUI system will need to update the batched GUI mesh, update the GUI element's mesh and/or update the layout position/size of the element.

There are three ways to notify the GUI system the element is dirty, each more expensive in performance than the previous:
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_markMeshAsDirty() "_markMeshAsDirty()" - Causes the batched GUI mesh to be re-assembled, will cause a call to `_fillBuffer`. Call this if element's size didn't change (e.g. when its position, or depth changes). Batched GUI mesh is a mesh managed by the GUI system that consists of multiple GUI elements sharing the same material properties (used to improve rendering performance).
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_markContentAsDirty() "_markContentAsDirty()" - Has the same effect as `_markMeshDirty()`, but will also trigger an `updateRenderElementsInternal` call so the GUI element mesh will be fully rebuilt. Call this when contents of the GUI element change, but not its size (e.g. changing a texture but it is the same dimensions as the old one.)
 - @ref BansheeEngine::GUIElement::_markLayoutAsDirty() "_markLayoutAsDirty()" - Has the same effect as `_markContentDirty()`, but will also cause the layout system to recalculate the element's position and size. This can be very expensive as this will generally trigger layout updates for all siblings and children, potentially even parent GUI elements. Call this when element changes and no other dirty calls are appropriate. Normally you have to call this whenever the element's size changes.

When updating your GUI element with new contents consider using the provided @ref BansheeEngine::GUIContent "GUIContent" type, in order to stay consistent with the built-in elements. It allows you to specify an image, text and a tooltip all in one. But this is completely optional.
 
# Various # {#customGUI_e}
 
## GUIWidget ## {#customGUI_d_a}
 
Every `GUIElement` is internally part of a specific `GUIWidget`. A `GUIWidget` is a @ref BansheeEngine::Component "Component" (@ref BansheeEngine::CGUIWidget "CGUIWidget") that can be attached to a scene object, and transformed like one. This allows you to perform arbitrary transformations on GUI elements.

You attach elements to a `GUIWidget` by adding them to the widget's @ref BansheeEngine::GUIPanel "GUIPanel". Each widget has a `GUIPanel` which is a `GUILayout` object that allows you to manually position GUI elements within it. Every GUI element's top level parent must be such a panel or they will not be rendered.

`GUIWidget` also allows you to control to which camera should the GUI elements within it be rendered. The camera provides the dimensions of the widget, and in turn the available area for all child GUI elements.

Every style that a `GUIElement` uses is retrieved from its parent `GUIWidget`. GUIWidget contains a @ref BansheeEngine::GUISkin "GUISkin" object which has a key-value map where style-names are mapped to particular GUI element styles. Changing the `GUISkin`, or moving a `GUIElement` to a widget with a different style will trigger the GUI element rebuild, so it can apply the new style options.

## GUIManager ## {#customGUI_d_b}

@ref BansheeEngine::GUIManager "GUIManager" is the top level GUI manager that handles almost everything GUI related. It keeps tracks of all `GUIWidget`s and `GUIElement`s. It updates layout when element properties change, rebuilds the GUI meshes, sets up GUI materials and ultimately renders the GUI. It also dispatches all GUI input events.

If you need to do some very deep changes to the GUI system this is where you do it.

## Text ##  {#customGUI_d_c}

If you ever require to render text completely manually (perhaps even outside of the GUI system), take a look at @ref BansheeEngine::TextData "TextData". It will take a text string with a font and optional bounds as input, and output (optionally) word wrapped text in the form of words and lines, from which you can easily retrieve a mesh for rendering.
 
## Scripting integration ## {#customGUI_d_d}

Once you have a custom GUI element you might want to expose it to the scripting API. Take a look at the [scripting interop guide](@ref scripting) to learn how to create scripting API objects. 

Every GUI scripting interop object must implement @ref BansheeEngine::TScriptGUIElement "TScriptGUIElement", but other than that creating GUI interop objects is the same as the general case described in the guide above. See @ref BansheeEngine::ScriptGUITexture "ScriptGUITexture" in `BsScriptGUITexture.cpp` for an example.

Creating managed GUI objects is again the same as the general case. Take a look at the managed GUITexture implementation in `GUITexture.cs` for an example.
