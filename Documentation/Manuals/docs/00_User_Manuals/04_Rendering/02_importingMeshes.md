title: Meshes
---

Meshes are used for defining surfaces of 2D and 3D objects, and are the primary building blocks of the scene. In bs::f meshes are represented with the @bs::Mesh class. A mesh is a resource, meaning it can be imported, saved and loaded as any other resource.

# Importing a mesh
Meshes can be imported from various third party formats, using the importer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Import a mesh named "dragon.fbx" from the disk
HMesh mesh = gImporter().import<Mesh>("dragon.fbx");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported formats are:
 - FBX
 - DAE
 - OBJ
 
# Creating a mesh
Meshes can also be created manually, which we cover later in the [creating meshes](../Advanced_Rendering/creatingMeshes) manual.
 
# Mesh properties
Once a mesh has been imported, you can retrieve its properties like vertex & index counts, as well as its bounds by calling @bs::Mesh::getProperties, which returns a @bs::MeshProperties object.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Retrieve and print out various mesh properties
auto& props = mesh->getProperties();

gDebug().logDebug("Num. vertices: " + toString(props.getNumVertices()));
gDebug().logDebug("Num. indices: " + toString(props.getNumIndices()));
gDebug().logDebug("Radius: " + toString(props.getBounds().getSphere().getRadius()));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> The debug logging functionality is explained in the [logging](../Utilities/logging) manual.

# Customizing import
Mesh import can be customized by providing a @bs::MeshImportOptions object to the importer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
auto importOptions = MeshImportOptions::create();
// Set required options here (as described below)

HMesh mesh = gImporter().import<Mesh>("dragon.fbx", importOptions);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets see some of the options you can use for customizing import.

## Scale
@bs::MeshImportOptions::importScale allows you to apply a uniform scale value to the mesh upon import. Although you can scale the size of a rendered mesh by adjusting the **SceneObject** transform when its placed in the scene, sometimes it is more useful to be able to do it once at import instead of every time you place it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Reduce the size of the mesh to 10% of its original size
importOptions->importScale = 0.1f;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Normals
@bs::MeshImportOptions::importNormals controls whether normal vectors are imported from the mesh file. 

Normal vectors are used in lighting and are required for any meshes placed in the 3D scene (unless rendering them manually using some custom method). They allow the mesh to appear smooth even though its surface is made out of triangles.

Most 3D authoring tools generate normals for their meshes, but if normals are not present in the mesh file, bs::f will attempt to generate normals automatically when this option is turned on.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Import or generate normals for the mesh
importOptions->importNormals = true;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Tangent
@bs::MeshImportOptions::importTangents controls whether tangent vectors are imported from the mesh file. 

Tangent vectors (along with normal vectors) are required if your rendering shader uses normal maps. Similar to normals, if tangents are not present in the mesh file, bs::f will attempt to generate them automatically.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Import or generate normals for the mesh
importOptions->importTangents = true;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Caching
Sometimes you need to import a mesh you don't want to only use for rendering, but rather for manually reading its contents. When that's the case you can enable the @bs::MeshImportOptions::cpuCached option.

This will allow you to call @bs::Mesh::getCachedData and to manually read individual vertices and indices of the mesh.

Note that caching a mesh means its data will be available in system memory, essentially doubling its memory usage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Enable caching
importOptions->cpuCached = true;

// Import mesh
HMesh mesh = gImporter().import<Mesh>("dragon.fbx", importOptions);

// Allocate a buffer to hold mesh contents
//// Specify vertex properties. Assuming just a single property of a 3D position
SPtr<VertexDataDesc> vertexDesc = VertexDataDesc::create();
vertexDesc->addVertElem(VET_FLOAT3, VES_POSITION);

// Read cached data
SPtr<MeshData> meshData = mesh->getCachedData();

// Read vertex positions
Vector<Vector3> vertices(8);
meshData->getVertexData(VES_POSITION, vertices.data(), vertices.size() * sizeof(Vector3));
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> **MeshData** is explained later in the [creating meshes](../Advanced_Rendering/creatingMeshes) manual.
