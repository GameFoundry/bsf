title: Renderable object
---

As the name implies, the renderable object allows you to display an object in the scene. It is represeted by the @bs::CRenderable component. The component requires you to assign a **Mesh** to render, as well as a **Material** to render the mesh with. Both of these are resources, and we'll explain them in the following chapters.

# Creating a renderable
**Renderable** is created as any component, and requires no additional parameters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
HSceneObject renderableSO = SceneObject::create("3D object");
HRenderable renderable = renderableSO->addComponent<CRenderable>();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Setting it up
Once created you must assign it a **Mesh** to render, and a **Material** to render it with. Use @bs::CRenderable::setMesh and @bs::CRenderable::setMaterial.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Create a standard PBR material
HShader shader = gBuiltinResources().getBuiltinShader(BuiltinShader::Standard);
HMaterial material = Material::create(shader);

// Import and assign a texture to the material
HTexture texture = gImporter().import<Texture>("myTexture.png");
material->setTexture("gAlbedoTex", texture);

// Import a mesh
HMesh mesh = gImporter().import<Mesh>("myMesh.fbx");

// Create a renderable
HSceneObject renderableSO = SceneObject::create("3D object");
HRenderable renderable = renderableSO->addComponent<CRenderable>();

// Assign material and mesh to the renderable
renderable->setMesh(mesh);
renderable->setMaterial(material);

// Optionally position the renderable in the scene
renderableSO->setPosition(Vector3(0.0f, 15.0f, 30.0f));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> Note that even though we always import resources in these examples, in production code you should load previously saved resources instead of importing them every time.

After the renderable has been set up, it will now be displayed in your camera view (if the camera is facing the direction of the renderable object).

# Multiple materials
In the example above we use a single material for a single mesh, but it can sometimes be useful to use different materials for different parts of the mesh.

It is up to the artist (creator of the mesh) to specify the regions of the mesh that will use separate materials. Upon mesh import those regions will be recognized as sub-meshes.

You can assign a different material to a sub-mesh by calling a @bs::CRenderable::setMaterial(UINT32, HMaterial) overload which accepts an additional index parameter, specifying which sub-mesh to apply the material on.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
HMesh mesh = gImporter().import<Mesh>("myMesh.fbx");
renderable->setMesh(mesh);

// Count the number of sub-meshes
auto& meshProps = mesh->getProperties();
UINT32 numSubMeshes = meshProps.getNumSubMeshes();

... create necessary materials ...

// Assign a different material on every submesh
for(UINT32 i = 0; i < numSubMeshes; i++)
	renderable->setMaterial(i, materials[i]);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
