# API Reference # {#mainpage_a}
API reference provides a documented list of all methods and classes in the framework. The entries are neatly categorized so you can browse the API even if you are not exactly sure what you are looking for. 

All entries are categorized into three primary groups:
 - <a class="el" href="group___layers.html">Core API</a> - Contains documentation for the user-facing API. This represents the main API that normal users will work with. This is the API referenced in "User manuals".
 - <a class="el" href="group___internals.html">Internals</a> - Reference documentation for internals of the framework core. Primarily useful for those modifying the framework but of less relevance for normal users.
 - <a class="el" href="group___plugins.html">Plugins</a> - Reference documentation for all available plugins. Plugins are various interchangeable libraries that contain high level systems built on top of abstractions defined in the framework core. If you are modifying the framework you might be interested in this documentation, but it can be skipped for normal users.
