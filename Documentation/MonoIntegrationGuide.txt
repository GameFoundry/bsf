---------------------------------Compiling runtime-------------------------------------
 - Grab Mono 5.4 (or newer) source code
  - From tarball: https://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/
   - If on Windows, get the release from GitHub instead as tarballs don't seem to be configured for Windows builds
  - Optionally check it out from git repository: https://github.com/mono/mono
   - If on Windows, make sure your git client has this set: "git config --global core.autocrlf input" as otherwise you'll have problems with line endings during later steps

 - Expose "mono_class_bind_generic_parameters" to the public:
  - In mono/metadata/object-internals.h change:
   MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic) MONO_INTERNAL; 
   to:
   MONO_API MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic);
   then move it to:
   mono/metadata/object.h
  - In mono/metadata/reflection.c modify:
   MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, gboolean is_dynamic)
   to:
   MonoClass* mono_class_bind_generic_parameters (MonoClass *klass, int type_argc, MonoType **types, mono_bool is_dynamic)
  - (Windows only) Add "mono_class_bind_generic_parameters" entry to mono/msvc/mono.def file

 - Build
  - Install Mono binary release (whichever one is the latest).
  - (Windows only)Add the "(InstallDir)\Mono\bin" to your PATH environment variable.
  - If on Windows:
   - Go to msvc/ folder to find mono.sln (Visual studio solution)
   - Open in VS2012 as is, or open in later VS and upgrade all projects to latest toolkit (v120 and v140 tested and working)
   - Generate missing header files:
    - First compile "genmdesc" project for desired configuration (debug/release, 32/64 bit)
    - Then run "runmdesc x64\bin\Debug\genmdesc x64" located in /msvc folder
     - Replace folder path to genmdesc you generated in the previous step
      - Replace x64 with Win32 for 32-bit builds
   - Compile mono project with desired configuration (debug/release, 32/64 bit, SGen builds were not tested). You will receive mono-2.0.dll and mono-2.0.lib as output.
    - Repeat the "genmdesc" step above for each configuration. Doing it once might be enough but be on the safe side.
  - If on Linux/Mac:
   - "./autogen.sh --prefix="(OutputDir)" --with-preview=yes"" (Replace (OutputDir) with a folder where you want to output the binaries, e.g. "C:\MonoInstall")
   - "./configure"
   - "make"
   - "make install"

 - Post build
  - (If using GDB only) Mono uses certain signals internally for normal operation. In order to avoid GDB triggering breakpoints when not required, put this in your .gdbinit file (in your $HOME path):
   - handle SIGXCPU SIG33 SIG35 SIG36 SIGPWR nostop noprint

-----------------------------Compiling libraries & compiler -------------------------------------
 - If on Linux/Mac the compiler and libraries should already be compiled using the above steps
 - If on Windows:
  - Install Cygwin 32-bit version using these command line parameters:
 setup-x86.exe -qnNdO -R "C:\cygwin" -s "http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com" 
   -l "C:\cygwin\var\cache\setup" -P autoconf -P automake -P bison -P gcc-core -P gcc-g++ -P mingw64-i686-runtime 
   -P mingw64-i686-binutils -P mingw64-i686-gcc-core -P mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ -P mingw64-i686-headers -P mingw64-i686-pthreads
   -P mingw64-i686-windows-default-manifest -P mingw64-i686-winpthreads -P w32api-headers -P w32api-runtime 
   -P windows-default-manifest -P libtool -P make -P python -P gettext-devel -P gettext -P intltool -P libiconv 
   -P pkg-config -P git -P wget -P curl
  - Go to your mono source directory (the one retrieved when compiling the runtime) in terminal (Cygwin or native) and enter these commands in order:
   - "./autogen.sh --prefix="(OutputDir)" --with-preview=yes"" (Replace (OutputDir) with a folder where you want to output the binaries, e.g. "C:\MonoInstall")
   - "./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32"
   - "make"
   - "make install"
  - Your built mono should now be output to (OutputDir) folder. (If it's not in that folder, check your Cygwin install folder under /usr/local)
 - Copy contents of (OutputDir)/include/mono/mono-2.0/mono to (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include/Mono
  - Make sure to modify "object.h" as you did above when building the binaries
 - Copy folder (OutputDir)/etc to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono
 - Copy assembly folders (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.0 and (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.5 to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/lib/mono/4.0 and (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/lib/mono/4.5, respectively
  - If you wish, you can clean up the assemblies within those folders are many might not be used. The minimum needed are "mscorlib.dll", "System.dll" and "System.Core.dll".
 - Copy the compiler (mcs executable) from (OutputDir)/lib/mono/4.5 to (BansheeRootDir)/bin/Mono/compiler
