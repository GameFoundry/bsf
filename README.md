bs::framework is a C++ library that aims to provide a unified foundation for the development of real-time graphical applications, whether games, engines or tools. 

**Highlights**
 * Built from the ground up in modern C++14 with a clean user-facing API 
 * Lightweight implementations without the crud often found in older, larger solutions
 * Clean, highly modular architecture that can be easily understood, modified and built upon
 * Cross-platform, highly optimized, multi-threaded core capable of running very demanding projects
 * Focus on modern technologies and high-fidelity graphics
 * Fully documented codebase with an extensive API reference

Current feature-set includes a wide range of high level systems, ranging from math and utility libraries, to a physically based renderer backed by Vulkan, DirectX or OpenGL, all the way to input, GUI, physics, audio, animation and scripting systems, with asset support for most popular resource formats.
 
# Features
* [Features](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/features.md) - A detailed list of all currently available features.
* [Roadmap](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/roadmap.md) - A list of features to be implemented in both near and far future. 

# Get started
* [Documentation](http://docs.bsframework.io/nightly/index.html) - Head over to the "User manuals" section to learn how to use the framework from the ground up. Use the API reference to look up what a particular class/method does.
* [Examples](https://github.com/gamefoundry/bsfExamples) - Grab a set of working examples and start tinkering and analyzing them to figure out how things work. They are well documented and can be used for quickly learning the framework.
* [Compiling](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/compiling.md) - Learn how to compile the framework from the source code.
