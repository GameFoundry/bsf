bs::framework is a C++ library that aims to provide a unified foundation for the development of real-time graphical applications, whether games, engines or tools. 

It provides a wide range of high level systems, ranging from math and utility libraries, to a physically based renderer backed by Vulkan, DirectX or OpenGL, all the way to input, GUI, physics, audio, animation and scripting systems, with asset support for most popular resource formats.

**Highlights**
 * Built from the ground up in modern C++14 with a clean user-facing API and lightweight implementations without the crud often found in older, larger solutions. Offers a clean, highly modular architecture that can be easily understood, modified and built upon.
 * Built on a cross-platform, highly optimized, multi-threaded core that is robust and capable of running very demanding projects. 
 * Fully documented codebase with an extensive API reference, as well as a set of manuals introducing you to most major systems.

The project's ultimate goal is to build a feature-set comparable to commercial offerings, while providing unparallel quality when it comes to design and performance, especially compared to similar open source libraries. 

If you are interested in helping the project reach this goal sooner, consider contributing by implementing some of the tasks on our [roadmap](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/roadmap.md).

# Features
* [Features](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/features.md) - A detailed list of all currently available features.
* [Roadmap](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/roadmap.md) - A list of features to be implemented in both near and far future. 

# Get started
* [Documentation](https://www.bsframework.io/docs/index.html) - Head over to the "User manuals" section to learn how to use the framework from the ground up. Use the API reference to look up what a particular class/method does.
* [Examples](https://github.com/gamefoundry/bsfExamples) - Grab a set of working examples and start tinkering and analyzing them to figure out how things work. They are well documented and can be used for quickly learning the framework.
* [Compiling](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/compiling.md) - Learn how to compile the framework from the source code.
