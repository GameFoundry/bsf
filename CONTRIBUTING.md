# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features requests](#features) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests or questions. Use the [community board](https://discourse.bsframework.io) instead. You can sign in using your GitHub credentials, making the process as simple as submitting an issue on GitHub itself.

* Please **do not** derail issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. Start a new issue for a new topic (bug, feature) instead of using the same thread for multiple topics.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` branch.

3. **Submit a crash log** &mdash; If your bug is causing a crash, `bsf` will generate a crash log in the `CrashReports` directory. Please submit this log along your report.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

If a feature is already listed in the [upcoming feature tracker](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AOFFICIAL) use that thread to discuss the feature and ask to be assigned to that particular task if you are interested in developing it.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.). See the [code style](https://www.bsframework.io/docs/code_style.html) guide and respect the style of surrounding code.
